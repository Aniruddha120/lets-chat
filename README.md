### Why PaLM API?

It's free, easy to use, and Powerful.

For free per number of token fees, the name of the model that came into my mind was LLAMA-2. But, it must be hosted in a cloud server and will charge fees. There is currently no free option to get LLAMA via API. But PaLM can be accessed via API without any charges.
